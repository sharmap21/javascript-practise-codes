# 🎲 Pick and Store - Dice Game (Two Player)

## 🛠️ Project Description

"Pick and Store" is a fun two-player dice game where players take turns rolling a dice, adding the dice number to their **current score**, and choosing to either **hold** or **risk rolling again**. 
- **If a player rolls a 1**, they lose all points collected in that round and the turn immediately switches to the next player.
- **Players can choose to "Hold"** and add their current score to their total score.
- **The first player to reach 100 points wins!**
- A **New Game** button resets everything to start fresh.

This project is built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It showcases DOM manipulation, event handling, conditionals, and basic game logic.
